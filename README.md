Hello There,

We have imported Pandas,matplotlib.pyplot and Numpy libraries 
Imported the dataset using pandas.
As a part of assignment, we created a function named **channel()** to display the first 1000 rows and copy them to a new data frame named **df_filtered**.
Exported the filtered rows to a .csv file named **Filtered_Data.csv**.

Created a function named **Distribution()** for plotting a distribution plot for the filtered rows using matplotlib.
